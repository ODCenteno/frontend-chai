## My process

I started watching the details and design requirements. After review the project I began to write HTML, followed by assigning classes. Next I started adding styles with CSS using a combination between grid and flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the most interesting this I need to look up to was how to style an image with an overlay.
